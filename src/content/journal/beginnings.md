The Forktree Project came into existence almost by accident.

It began with a tentative desire for a modest rural block on which to stretch, be at one with nature and have the time and space to think.

However, an initial search for a rural hideaway revealed something very different - a property, with a dramatic setting, that was crying out for help, denuded and exhausted after wholescale clearance of trees by 19th-century pastoralists, ensuing decades of pastoral activity, and a recent history of being used as a dumping ground for building waste.

Now the Forktree Project has begun - an ambitious but exciting project to bring this spot back to life so that its natural ecosystem can thrive and support the biodiversity endemic to the local area.

Let's get started - there's important work to be done.
