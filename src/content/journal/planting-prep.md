As we get started on planting season 2023, there’s still work to be done in the nursery, ensuring that plants will be ready to be planted throughout the winter, and some for next year too.

As usual our aim is to plant a range of upper-storey, mid-storey and under-storey species so as to establish biodiverse native habitat for native fauna. The last six months in the nursery have been busy as the Forktree nursery team have overseen the propagating and nurturing of our saplings, tending to them and keeping them healthy, ensuring they are ready on time - and having fun along the way.

Many thanks to all the team and also to the volunteers working alongside them - your work is invaluable.
