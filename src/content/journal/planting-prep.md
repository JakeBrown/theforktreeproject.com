It is already the beginning of June, and we are getting ready for our first big week of planting, with 200 Year 7 students from Adelaide Botanic High School due to visit.

This time last year (and the years before that) we were already well and truly under way with planting by the beginning of June, but this year is different. It shouldn't be this dry at this time of year - the challenge this presents when digging holes for planting is a sobering reminder of the realities of climate change.

It also reminds us why habitat restoration is so important: trees and shrubs are climate moderators, generating over 40% of the precipitation over land via evaporation and transpiration of water from their leaves. Land clearance reduces rainfall; habitat restoration increases it and, crucially, moderates it.

So let's get planting!
