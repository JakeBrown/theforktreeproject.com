Great to share the story of The Forktree Project at our Open Day this morning as part of the Nature Festival 2024.

Thank you to the wonderful group of visitors who joined us for a tour and discussion of the vision and purpose of the project - great to meet you all and hear of your own environmental projects, plans and interests.

For anyone who wanted to attend but was unable to do so, we will hold another open day in April. Watch this space for details nearer the time!
