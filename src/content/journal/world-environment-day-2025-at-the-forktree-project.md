It's 5th June: World Environment Day. A day that focuses on the importance of us all doing our bit to protect nature.

What better way visual indicator of our commitment at The Forktree Project to restoring biodiversity than images of saplings in the Forktree Project Nursery looking beautiful, lush and strong, ready to fight the good fight of restoring ecosystem health.

We are super proud of these stunning, healthy trees and shrubs and are grateful to nursery manager Fleur and the regular volunteers for tending to them with such care. We are looking forward to getting all our saplings in the ground this winter! Doing our bit towards 30x30 ecosystem restoration goals, one plant at a time.

Let's all do our bit for World Environment Day. Together we can make a real difference.
