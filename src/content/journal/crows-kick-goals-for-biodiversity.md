How good are elite sportsmen at environmental volunteering? Amazing, if the Adelaide Crows are anything to go by!

A huge thank you to the Adelaide Crows players and coaches who came to The Forktree Project on Monday for a morning of high-energy olive removal and tree planting.

Banter, laughter and a healthy dose of sporting competitiveness on the hillside meant that 16 massive olives were dug out - an incredible effort and a worthy workout! And about 300 native trees and shrubs were planted, contributing to the restoration of biodiverse habitat on the site. Kicking goals of a very different but very rewarding kind!

Great to share the vision of The Forktree Project - and the reasons why - with the team, as well as the wellbeing benefits of time spent in nature and of contributing to the greater good.

Thank you for your positive energy, enthusiasm and determination, Adelaide Crows - it was great to host you at Forktree and you are welcome back any time!
