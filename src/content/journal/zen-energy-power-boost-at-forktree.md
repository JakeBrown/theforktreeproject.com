A huge thank you to the cheerful and positive group of volunteers from ZEN Energy, MAC Trade Services and Salesforce who planted several hundred blue gum community trees and shrubs to build habitat in the slopes of one of the gullies at The Forktree Project this week AND removed three big olive trees - an incredible effort!

Thank you to Wes Bloss from ZEN Energy for coordinating the day. A day full of positivity and purpose, topped off with beautiful sunshine and perfect planting conditions - a great day kicking goals in the outdoor office!

Many thanks to ZEN for their continued support of The Forktree Project - it is greatly appreciated. We look forward to continued partnership with you and to achieving great results for the planet together.
