22nd May: today is International Day for Biological Diversity.

This year's theme: Be Part of the Plan.

What a great reminder of our collective responsibility to do our bit to halt biodiversity loss by restoring habitat, step by step, seed by seed.

At The Forktree Project we are well aware that the realisation of our habitat restoration vision starts at the tiniest of levels - with harvesting seed from a variety of plants across numerous vegetation communities, all endemic to our region, and cleaning, sorting and storing it, ready to be sown when the time is right.

A perfect activity for a rainy day! And a perfect way to mark International Day for Biological Diversity.
