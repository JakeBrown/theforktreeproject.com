After a massive four days of planting with Year 9 students from both Westminster School and Woodcroft College, nature's gift to us was this spectacular sunset blazing gloriously over some of the students' new plantings.

An amazing job, Westminster and Woodcroft - a total of 1,150 native trees and shrubs planted over four days, not to mention the sorting and cleaning of planting tubes for reuse as well as clearance of invasive species to prep planting areas.

Real-life, hands-on learning about biodiversity, sustainable choices and the power of purpose. So rewarding to see what can be achieved through shared purpose. Imagine how much more could be achieved if everyone got involved for even just one day in a local habitat restoration project!
