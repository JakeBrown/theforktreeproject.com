The slogan for World Environment Day 2024 (5th June) is: “Our land. Our future. We are [#GenerationRestoration](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/generationrestoration/).” A powerful reminder of our responsibility to rebuild native habitat for the good of the planet and the species we share it with, and for our own benefit too - and that the time to do so is now.

A thrill for us at The Forktree Project a few days ago, therefore, to see a flock of yellow-tailed black cockatoos roosting in drooping sheoaks (Allocasuarina verticillata) that were planted only four years ago but are already strong enough to provide a secure resting place and a food source for these big, beautiful, endangered birds.

Restoration efforts reaping rewards already - beautiful and thrilling. Nature’s inspiration for Generation Restoration - it works.
