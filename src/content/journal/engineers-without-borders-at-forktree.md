A huge thank you to the volunteers from the South Australian chapter of Engineers Without Borders who did an amazing job at The Forktree Project on Sunday, working together to roo-proof the fencing around our Rare Seed Orchard and to continue the harvesting of our first big crop of wallaby grasses.

A great combo of jobs: physically challenging fencing work offset by wonderfully mindful, peaceful seed harvesting - and both vitally important to our habitat restoration work.

Thank you, Engineers Without Borders - an awesome effort from awesome volunteers from an awesome organisation. You rock.
