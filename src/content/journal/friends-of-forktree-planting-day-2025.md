Thank you to all the volunteers who helped out at our Friends of Forktree Planting Day on Saturday 26th July to mark National Tree Day 2025 - a truly awesome bunch who turned up and got stuck in, despite the weather forecast!

A fantastic effort by all saw us extend and enrich our pink gum association and manna gum association planting areas at The Forktree Project - important steps in our bid to restore endemic, biodiverse habitat on these hills.

 A huge thank you too to the Forktree team (Fleur, Doug, Ralph, Ollie and Adam) for doing such a fabulous job setting up and guiding. A great day spent with a great group of people all wanting to do their bit for the environment. Together we can make a real difference.
