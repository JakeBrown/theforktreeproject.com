So exciting to be reaping our first bumper harvest of *Rytidosperma tenuis*, a rare species of wallaby grass, from one of our production beds in the Forktree Rare Seed Orchard!

What started as small, spindly tubestock planted out in the production bed 12 months ago (photo 2) had grown by 4 weeks ago into long, lush grasses laden with promise. And now it is ripe and golden, ready for harvesting.

What an amazing year! Reaping seeds of hope for the healthy restoration of native biodiversity at scale! We can't wait to use the seed in direct seeding projects across the Forktree site and beyond.
