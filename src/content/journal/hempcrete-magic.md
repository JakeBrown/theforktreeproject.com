We are VERY, VERY PROUD of our first hempcrete wall at The Forktree Project!

Not only did the hemp sequester carbon while it grew as a crop, but it will continue to do so now that it is a wall - for as long as the wall is standing.

In addition, hempcrete is way more fire retardant than standard building materials and has superior sound and heat insulation properties. AND it looks great!

Regenerative design - even more powerful than sustainable design. We can’t wait to build the next wall!

A huge thank you to everyone who put it together – a massive team effort. But how good does it feel to have built something so powerful in the fight against climate change??

1 bulka bag of hemp + 25 bags of lime + 6 people + 1 mixer x 2 days = 1,000kg CO2 sequestered or 600,000 charges of a smart phone. What’s not to like?
