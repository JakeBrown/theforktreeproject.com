A huge thank you to the wonderful team of volunteers from Deloitte Adelaide who visited The Forktree Project this Wednesday for a day of corporate volunteering.

What a fantastic group, all of whom got stuck into a range of tasks from weeding and mulch spreading to potting table maintenance, pad resurfacing and pricking out of seedlings in the nursery. Big smiles and good cheer all round - a dream team!

Thank you, Deloitte - you are welcome back any time! And thank you to FNPW (Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife) for coordinating this corporate volunteering day.
