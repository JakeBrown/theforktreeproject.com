It’s an exciting time at The Forktree Project as we watch and wait to see the results of recent direct seeding of native grasses on two hectares of former paddock at The Forktree Project.

Huge thanks to Andrew Fairney and his team at Seeding Natives for their expertise in preparing the clay-heavy Biscay soil of this part of the site for direct seeding, using innovative inversion ploughing and dry sowing to ensure success.

To quote Andrew, ‘People may say, "that's a bit early isn't it?" Normally you would be correct in thinking that; however, when sowing the 'Bay of Biscay' clay soils found at The Forktree Project, even minimal soil moisture makes it nearly impossible to sow, very messy to say the least. The solution is dry sowing.’

Seeding Natives and the Future For Native Grasslands Fund have contributed funding and expertise to the site preparation and sowing of a two hectare native grassland area at Forktree, and we couldn’t be more grateful.

.Ecology restoration from the bottom up: restoring the base layer first - the often-overlooked but vitally important cornerstone of building back biodiverse habitat.

Thank you, Seeding Natives, for your expertise, support and partnership. Exciting times as we watch and wait to see the native grasses take hold and enrich the biodiversity of the site.
