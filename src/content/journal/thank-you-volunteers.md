On International Volunteers Day we would like to extend a HUGE thank you to all our wonderful volunteers who make such a massive contribution to the work of The Forktree Project.

Propagating in the nursery and seed harvesting in summer, planting in winter, painting tables, mending fences, building walls, washing pots, scuffing weeds... just a few of the pieces of the jigsaw of the rewilding work of The Forktree Project.

A special shout out to Ralph, volunteer extraordinaire, who has done so much for the project over the last few years and is a much loved member of the Forktree family. Thank you, Ralph - you are a legend.

And to all our volunteers - your generous contribution makes such a difference - thank you from us and the planet.
