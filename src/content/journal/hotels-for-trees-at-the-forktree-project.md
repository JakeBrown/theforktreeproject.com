We were excited and proud to celebrate this week an innovative new partnership between The Forktree Project and environmental not-for-profit Hotels For Trees and the beautiful Mount Lofty House with a fabulous team day at The Forktree Project. It was wonderful to welcome the awesome team from Mount Lofty House along with Hugo from Hotels For Trees for a day of team volunteering that involved planting, resource management and a tour of the project.

Already a leader in boutique hotel style, Mount Lofty House is now also a leader in sustainability as the first SA hotel to sign up with Hotels For Trees' tree planting scheme, through which a tree is planted every time a guest chooses to skip the daily room clean.

What a truly brilliant concept - we LOVE IT!! Great to have the Mount Lofty House team with us planting the trees they and their guests have fundraised for to date - completing the giving circle and having a great time while doing it!

A huge thank you to Hotels For Trees' Australia and New Zealand Tree Planting Officer Hugo van Roermund for enabling this great partnership. We are excited to see what we can achieve together with Hotels For Trees, Mount Lofty House and their guests. Team work at its best.
