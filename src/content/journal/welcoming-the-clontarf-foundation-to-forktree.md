What a fantastic day we had at The Forktree Project on Thursday when we welcomed Aboriginal students from the Clontarf Academy at Woodville High School.

It was a real pleasure to work with these awesome young men in the Forktree Nursery, where together we pricked out and potted on native grasses (wallaby grass), and in the Rare Seed Orchard, where we planted wallaby grasses into our seed production beds - two separate stages of our drive to boost populations of native grasses across the region.

Great to share with these engaged young men the importance of restoring native habitat and to discuss with them ideas and plans for a garden at Forktree showcasing plants of cultural significance. What a feel-good day as we all agreed on the amazing power of purpose and how good it feels to work together to restore and protect the environment.

And a real honour to collaborate with the Clontarf Foundation which does such amazing work with young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men. Thank you, Clontarf and Woodville - we look forward to welcoming you back to Forktree soon!
