Very exciting  to see the outside of the Forktree Project Environment Centre taking shape!

Another step in the project’s circular economy journey: the  flaking, painted tin sheets of the external walls were flipped to  uncover gems of retro Australiana - the reds, blues and blacks of 1930s Lysaght galvanised corrugated iron branding, as well as batch numbers  hand-painted by shearers to keep track of their work.

Wonderful not just  to reuse old, degraded materials and bring them back to life but also  to explore the history they reveal.  The next step is salvaging more old  tin sheets to complete the walls - keeping more unwanted sheets out of  landfill. Circular economy alive and kicking at Forktree - can’t wait to  see the end result!
