What a great day at The Forktree Project last week with the team from KESAB (Keep South Australia Beautiful).

Just fantastic to share the Forktree circular economy story with these waste management experts - from cleaning, sorting and reusing donated forestry tubes in the nursery, making potting tables out of salvaged pallets and raised beds out of waste concrete, to retaining walls filled within building rubble to name just a few of our repurposing strategies. If ever there was an audience to fully appreciate our efforts with regards to the circular economy, KESAB is it!!

Thank you, KESAB, for your super volunteering - pricking out plants and washing pots in the nursery and sorting seed in the main shed - what a great way to spend some time, putting the world to rights, chatting and laughing, as we sifted through this extraordinary first harvest of rytidosperma tenuis (rare wallaby grass).

Just wonderful to discuss all things sustainability education with you all - so many great ideas and such synergy. Really looking further to future collaborations between Forktree and KESAB.
