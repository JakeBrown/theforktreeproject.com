While setting out stakes for next week's planting, we took a moment to marvel at the amazing growth of our first year's plantings. Planted only 5 years ago in 2019, these drooping sheoaks are a magnificent testament to what can be achieved.

Planted 5 years ago as small saplings, and now standing over 4 metres tall, they are providing food and habitat for numerous species (including the stunning flock of yellow-tailed black cockatoos that seems to have discovered us) and shading out invasive species. Not to mention the carbon they are sequestering.

From little things big things really do grow.
