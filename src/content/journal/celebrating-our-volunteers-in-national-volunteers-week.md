As we approach the end of National Volunteers Week, here's a HUGE thank you to all the volunteers who have helped at The Forktree Project over the last few years, and who continue to do so.

Ambitious ecology restoration projects like Forktree are made possible by the involvement of volunteers, and we are hugely grateful to everyone who has helped us restore habitat in this beautiful corner of South Australia. Your involvement is invaluable.

Volunteering at The Forktree Project takes many forms, from planting trees and shrubs on the slopes in winter to propagating in the Forktree Nursery in spring and summer, to helping with our circular economy challenge and assisting with the building of infrastructure such as garden beds. Whatever the task, volunteers are playing a vital role in helping boost biodiversity - also having fun and feeling good along the way.

If you are interested in volunteering at The Forktree Project, we would love to hear from you! Contact us via the contact page on this website, via email at hello@theforktreeproject.
