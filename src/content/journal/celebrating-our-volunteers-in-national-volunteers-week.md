This week is National Volunteer Week, and what better opportunity to acknowledge all the people who have volunteered at The Forktree Project over the last four years!

A wide range of volunteers have helped out on site, from school students, corporate teams, community groups, interested individuals and families up for getting out in nature together. To each and every one of you, **THANK YOU** for your time and commitment - your involvement has helped so much.

Volunteering for The Forktree Project takes so many forms - tree planting, propagating, land management, but also circular economy activities and infrastructure work to name just a few. Whatever your skills, you can make a real difference in one way or another, both on or off site.

Welcoming volunteers to The Forktree Project has created the opportuntiy to meet so many great people who all want to make a difference. The theme of National Volunteer Week 2023 is **“The Change Makers”** -  and that is indeed what all of The Forktee volunteers are: individuals who want to restore habitat and contribute to making our environment healthier for generations to come.

So, a massive **THANK YOU** to those of you who have volunteered at Forktree to date, and to anyone else who is interested, please get in touch. As you can see from the photos below, we have a lot of fun!
