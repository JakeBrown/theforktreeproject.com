We are still on a high after such a wonderful day on Saturday at our Friends of Forktree Planting Day to mark National Tree Day!

 What a fantastic turn out from over 70 volunteers of all ages who all got stuck in planting 1200 trees and shrubs to help recreate habitat at The Forktree Project.

Sunshine; a sparkling ocean backdrop; good company and good cheer; the health tonic of time spent in nature; happy saplings spreading their roots into the ground; feel good doing good… what’s not to like??

THANK YOU once again, Friends of Forktree - you are welcome any time!
