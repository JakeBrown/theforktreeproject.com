One of today’s education buzzwords is “Lifelong Learning”. At The Forktree Project we are big believers in this concept: the fact that we can - and should - all keep learning every day of our lives.

It is always a pleasure to welcome teams to The Forktree Project for a day of volunteering and environmental learning - a day which brings challenge, fun, new perspectives and richly rewarding opportunity to interact with colleagues in a new environment, learning new things together.

Just such a day was had at The Forktree Project last week with a brilliant crew of  49 volunteers from the Adelaide office of Ernst & Young. So much  achieved, from pricking out and potting on plants in the nursery,  washing and preparing forestry tubes (super important to reuse resources  - one of our passions at Forktree) to fencing and seed sorting and  cleaning. Exciting to see such progress in a single day - and to see a  big team having a great time being out together in nature, contributing  purposefully to the environment. Thank you, EY - hope to welcome you  back to Forktree again soon!
