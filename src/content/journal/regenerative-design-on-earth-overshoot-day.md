24th July - Earth Overshoot Day 2025… the point in the year at which humanity has used up all the resources that the planet can regenerate in the calendar year.

Even more confronting is the fact that Australia’s Country Overshoot Day 2025 was 19th March… a pretty sobering statistic.

Finding ways of reducing our ecological footprint is more important than ever, and we are pretty excited at The Forktree Project to have built our second hempcrete wall this week.

Our aim is not just to use sustainable practices but, even more importantly, to incorporate regenerative design - in other words design that actually makes things better. Our hempcrete walls will do just that, sequestering carbon for as long as they are standing.

Each wall is a small step in the right direction. Let’s [#movethedate](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/movethedate/).

A huge thank you to our awesome wall building team - camaraderie and teamwork at its best.
