Another super-rewarding day at The Forktree Project recently with a visit from Bush Heritage's People, Safety, and Culture Team, gathered from across Australia.

Feedback from Bush Heritage: "an inspiring morning with The Forktree Project, immersing ourselves in the organisation's impactful work and contributing hands-on in the nursery".

Thank you, Bush Heritage - it was a privilege to welcome you, to share the Forktree story with you all and to hear about Bush Heritage's experiences of restoring and protecting habitat across the country. And fantastic to have your assistance in the nursery - top-quality, knowledgeable volunteers! You are welcome back any time!
