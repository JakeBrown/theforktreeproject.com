Another marvelling-at-nature moment: walking to the far end of the project to set out stakes for our next planned planting session and rediscovering these magnificent, statuesque manna gums (Eucalyptus viminalis) planted ONLY FOUR YEARS AGO!

Look at the size of this tree! What a thrill to see it standing tall and triumphant, healthy and thriving - a stunning symbol of what we are working towards.

In time this section of the property will be lush with manna gum community vegetation, a biodiverse ecosystem that will provide habitat for a wide range of native fauna, including hopefully koalas (manna gums are the preferred food source for koalas).

We are excited to watch this space - and, at the rate these manna gums are growing, maybe not for long!
