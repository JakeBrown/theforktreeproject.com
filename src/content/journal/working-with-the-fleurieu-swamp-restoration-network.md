What a glorious day it was on Saturday when we hosted the landowners of the Fleurieu Swamp Restoration Network at The Forktree Project for their end-of-autumn field day.

We at The Forktree Project are proud of our partnership with this engaged and community of landowners who are fully committed as a collective to restoration of swamp ecosystems across the Fleurieu. It has been a pleasure to grow the Network’s plants for this coming planting season, and to work collaboratively with them to ensure a wide range of beautiful, healthy, appropriately provenanced and biodiverse plants for their collective of properties.

It was a day of knowledge-sharing and learning as Forktree Nursery Manager Fleur delivered a fascinating, far-reaching workshop on the plants growing for the Network and how to ensure success when they are planted.

Many thanks  to Fleurieu Swamp Restoration Network leader John Fargher for organising  the day and for Forktree Project Nursery Manager Fleur for sharing her  extensive knowledge of nursery practices, propagation and plant health  with the group.

We wish John and the Network members all the best for their July planting day as they work together to restore vitally important wetland habitat across the Fleurieu region. We can’t wait to see photos and hear updates, and we look forward to  working together again next growing season to continue on our shared  habitat restoration mission.
