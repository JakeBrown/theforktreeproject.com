It was a pleasure to host Newday Leadership again at the Forktree Project yesterday for the second session of their Newday Inspired Leadership 2024 program with their 2024 cohort of amazing regional leaders.

With the focus of the day being "wellbeing - inside and out", it was thought-provoking and rewarding to explore with the cohort the significant wellbeing benefits that we have experienced at The Forktree Project of purposeful engagement in habitat restoration and rewilding - a perfect example of how working towards the "outer" wellbeing of our environment delivers significant "inner wellbeing" benefits to us as individuals and as a community.

A huge thank you to Katrina Webb and Matthew Wright Simon of Newday for what is indeed Inspired Leadership from them both - amazing work! Always a pleasure to work with you, Katrina and Matthew.
